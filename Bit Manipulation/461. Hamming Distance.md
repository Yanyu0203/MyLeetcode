Description:

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

思路：两个数字进行异或后记录有几个1即可。

```c++
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int diff = x ^ y, res = 0;
        while(diff) {
            res += diff & 1;
            diff >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
```

Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)
