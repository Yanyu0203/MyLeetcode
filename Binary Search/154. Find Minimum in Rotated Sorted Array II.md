Description:

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

思路：这类题都是根据局部有序来二分查找的。是153的变形，若mid和right相等就--right就行

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;
        while(low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if(nums[mid] < nums[high]) {
                high = mid;
            } else if(nums[mid] > nums[high]) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                --high;
            }
        }
        return nums[low];
    }
};
```

Time: O(logn)

Space: O(1)
