Description:

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

思路：简单的双指针搜索办法。left从头right从尾，比较与更新最大容量，同时比较left和right的高度，移动较小的。

```c++
int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int n = height.size();
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        int maxv = 0;
        while(left < right) {
            int area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);
            maxv = max(maxv,  area);
            height[left] <= height[right] ? ++left : --right;
        }
        return maxv;
    }
```

Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)
