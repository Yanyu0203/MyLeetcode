Description:

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

思路：动态规划的方法，记录最小买价和最大收益，对每一步，更新最大收益和最小买价。

```c++
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buyprice = prices[0], max_profit = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            max_profit = max(max_profit, prices[i] - buyprice);
            buyprice = min(prices[i], buyprice);
        }
        return max_profit;
    }
```
