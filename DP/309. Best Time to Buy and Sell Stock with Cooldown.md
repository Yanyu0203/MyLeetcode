Description:

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

思路：对于每一天结束我们有三种情况：持有股票，不持有处于冷冻期，不持有不处于冷冻期。对于持有股票，要不就是i-1已经持有，要不就是本日买入；对于不持有处于冷冻期，只有可能是本日买入；对于不持有不处于冷冻期，可能是i-1已持有或i-1买入。对此维护三个数来计算三种情况下的最大收益。

```c++
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        int f0 = -prices[0];
        int f1 = 0, f2 = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int t0 = max(f0, f2 - prices[i]);
            int t1 = f0 + prices[i];
            int t2 = max(f1, f2);
            f0 = t0;
            f1 = t1;
            f2 = t2;
        }
        return max(f1, f2);
    }
```
