Description:

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

思路：经典动态规划。是否抢劫这家取决于抢劫前一家和抢劫前前一家加上抢劫这家哪一个大，由于是否抢劫只与前家和前前家有关，因此可以将复杂度降至O(1)

```c++
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int p = 0, q = 0, cur;
        for(auto num : nums) {
            cur = max(p + num, q);
            p = q;
            q = cur;
        }
        return cur;
    }
```

Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)
