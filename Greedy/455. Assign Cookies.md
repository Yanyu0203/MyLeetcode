Description: 
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

思路：
根据贪心的思想，需要用最少的cookies满足当前胃口最小的child。因此对g和s进行排序，遍历即可。

code：
```c++
int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        sort(g.begin(), g.end());
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());
        int child = 0, cookie = 0;
        while(child < g.size() && cookie < s.size()) {
            if(g[child] <= s[cookie]) {
                child++;
            }
            cookie++;
        }
        return child;
    }
```
