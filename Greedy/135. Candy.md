Description: 
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.

Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

思路：评分高的孩子只需比其左右两边高即可。因此使用两次遍历，第一次从左往右遍历，若右边比左边高则右边等于左边+1；第二次从右往左遍历，若左边比右边高则左边等于max(右边+1，左边)

code：
```c++
int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        int n = ratings.size();
        vector<int> candies(n, 1);
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        for(int j = n - 1; j > 0; j--) {
            if(ratings[j - 1] > ratings[j]) {
                candies[j - 1] = max(candies[j] + 1, candies[j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return accumulate(candies.begin(), candies.end(), 0);
    }
```
