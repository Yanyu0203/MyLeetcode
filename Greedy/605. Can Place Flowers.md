Description:

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

思路：采用跳格子的办法，若此时为1，则往后跳两格；若此时为1且在数组末尾或后面没有花，可以种植，跳两格；后面有花，跳三格。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
        int i = 0, len = flowerbed.size();
        while(i < len && n > 0) {
            if(flowerbed[i] == 1) {
                i += 2;
            } else if(i == len - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0) {
                --n;
                i += 2;
            } else {
                i += 3;
            }
        }
        return n <= 0;
    }
};
```

Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)
