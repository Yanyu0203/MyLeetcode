[Link](https://leetcode.cn/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/description/)

Description:

You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).

思路：将身高从大到小、人数从小到大排列后，进行插入。对于每一个插入i，只需保证其前有ki个人即可，因为在他后面排的不是身高比他矮，就是人数比他多，并不会影响到他。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> reconstructQueue(vector<vector<int>>& people) {
        sort(people.begin(), people.end(), [](const vector<int> &a, const vector<int> &b) {
            return a[0] > b[0] || (a[0] == b[0] && a[1] < b[1]);
        });
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        for(const vector<int> &person : people) {
            res.insert(res.begin() + person[1], person);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
