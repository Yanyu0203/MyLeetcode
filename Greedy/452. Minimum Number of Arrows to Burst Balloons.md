Description:

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

思路：使用贪心的方法。为了能一次射穿尽可能多的气球，我们需要将每个气球的右边界从小到大排序，然后选择当前最小的右边界，并将左边界小于该右边界的区间全部去除。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [](const vector<int> &a, const vector<int> &b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });
        int pos = points[0][1], res = 1;
        for(const auto &point : points) {
            if(point[0] > pos) {
                ++res;
                pos = point[1];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
